# workflow
Bash Script to manage an R based workflow. 

The knitted markdowns can be hosted on GitHub / GitLab pages. For GitLab, this process is automatic. There you can host our pages from private repositores.
In GitHub however, this process can not be automated without manually changing settings on the website.
In any case, GitHub only allows hosting from public repositories which is not recommended due to data safety issues.

## Note
For a smooth setup process, initiate a completely empty repository (no markdown or .gitignore). If you manually want to add a git repository, just skip when the tool prompts you for input.
